Type algebra is a much underwritten topic in TypeScript, a topic that I found essential to understand some quirks in TypeScript.

## Algebras

We all have learned some algebraic laws from our math classes:

1. multiplication distributes over addition: the `x` in `x * (y + z)` distributes over `y + z`. We can rewrite it as `(x * y) + (x * z)` 
2. addition doesn't distribute over multiplication. `x + (y * z)` We can't rewrite that expression as `(x + y) * (x + z)`.


And there is [boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra), which is a little different than the ordinary algebra we just saw:

1. Logical conjunction (and, the `&&` operator in JavaScript)  distributes over the disjunction (or, the `||` operator in JavaScript): the `x` in `x && (y || z)` distributes over `y || z`  , resulting in the equivalent expression `(x && y) || (x && z)`
2. the disjunction (`||`) also distributes over conjunction (`&&`). For `x || (y && z)`, we rewrite that expression as `(x || y) && (x || z)`

Lastly there is [set algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets). In Set Theory we have union (∪, the `|` operator in TypeScript) and intersection (∩, the `&` opeartor in TypeScript) operation:

1. intersection distributes over union: the type `A & (B | C)` is equivalent to `(A & B) | (A & C)`. We've distributed the `A` over the `B | C`.
2. union also distributes over intersection: The type `A | (B & C)` is equivalent to `(A | B) & (A | C)`.

TypeScript is very much related to Set Theory and the union and intersection operations around types also follow the algebraic laws in Set Theory - in the context of TypeScript, I call this **type algebra**.

Although I doubt you would write complex types like `A & (B | C)` everyday, sometimes you do have to reason through the type algebra to decipher TypeScript error messages and find out what’s happening.

## Apply type algebra

Now let’s walk through a concrete (contrived) example and see how we can apply type algebra to understand a potential type error.

Imagine we have two types of tech events - conferences and meetup. Conferences can be held either in-person or online virtually via Zoom while meetups must be held in-person at some physical location. And we have a type TechEvent which is a union of those two types of events. Finally we have an `IsVirtual` object type that only specifies `{isVirtual: true}`.

```typescript
type Conference = {type: 'conference', isVirtual: boolean} 
type Meetup = {type: 'meetup', isVirtual: false} 
type TechEvent = Conference | Meetup
type IsVirtual = {isVirtual: true} 

// We intersect IsVirtual with conference and meetup, then explore the resulting type.
type VirtualEvent = IsVirtual & TechEvent 
```

First we use the resulting `VirtualEvent` type to type a variable for `Conference`:

```typescript
const conference: VirtualEvent = {type: 'conference', isVirtual: true} // ✅
```

If we messed up the `isVirtual` property, we get a type error requiring `isVirtual` to be `true`:

```typescript
const conference: VirtualEvent = {type: 'conference', isVirtual: false} // ❌ type 'false' is not assignable to type 'true'
```

We start with the type `IsVirtual & TechEvent`. It's easier to think about this type if we distribute the intersection over the union.

```typescript
// By applying type algebra, we get three equivalent types:
type VirtualEvent = IsVirtual & TechEvent
type VirtualEvent = IsVirtual & (Conference | Meetup)
type VirtualEvent = (IsVirtual & Conference) | (IsVirtual & Meetup)
```

The `conference` variable requires its `isVirtual` to be `true` because the `Conference` type has `isVirtual: boolean`, but the type `IsVirtual` has `isVirtual: true`. When we intersect the two types, we get `isVirtual: boolean & true`. Intersecting `boolean & true` is equivalent to just `true`. That is why the type error above is asking for `true` for the `isVirtual` property.

So far it seems pretty straightforward. However for the type `Meetup`, things are much more complicated. `Meetup` has `isVirtual: false`. What happens when we intersect that with `isVirtual: true` in `IsVirtual`?  If you are familiar with TypeScript you might know that an impossible intersection produces the `never` type. Therefore, we might expect `{type: 'meetup', isVirtual: false} & {isVirtual: true}` to give us `{type: 'meetup', isVirtual: never}`. 

> If you are not familiar with the never type, I have written [a blog post](type-hierarchy-tree#the-bottom-of-the-tree) covering that as well.

Let’s create a `meetup` variable to verify our assumptions:

```typescript
const meetup: VirtualEvent = {type: 'meetup', isVirtual: true} // ❌ Type '"meetup"' is not assignable to type '"conference"'
```

The code above doesn’t compile, which is expected. The type error message is interesting though. What does `conference` have to do with this `meetup` variable? The variable is for a meetup, not a conference. Here the compiler is not going to tell us exactly why something went wrong, so we have to work the types out for ourselves through type algebra:

1. The type `VirtualEvent` is created by the intersection `(IsVirtual & Conference) | (IsVirtual & Meetup)`
2. The right side of the union `IsVirtual & Meetup` is `{isVirtual: true} & {type: 'meetup', isVirtual: false}`, which gives us `never` because `true & false` for the `isVirtual` property is an empty intersection.
3. Now the intersection becomes `(IsVirtual & Conference) | never` and TypeScript automatically discards `never` from a union type.
4. Now the intersection becomes just `IsVirtual & Conference`, which is `{type: 'conference', isVirtual: true}`

Go back to the erroneous assignment:

```typescript
const meetup: VirtualEvent = {type: 'meetup', isVirtual: true} // ❌ Type '"meetup"' is not assignable to type '"conference"'   
```

We get an identical error message by replacing the `VirtualEvent` type with the equivalent version that we got through type algebra - `{type: 'conference', isVirtual: true}`

```typescript
const meetup: {type: 'conference', isVirtual: true} = {type: 'meetup', isVirtual: true} // ❌ Type '"meetup"' is not assignable to type '"conference"'   
```

Now it becomes apparent as to why the the compiler reported that 'meetup' isn't assignable to 'conference'.

> You might think `{isVirtual: true} & {type: 'meetup', isVirtual: false}` should give us `{type: 'meetup', isVirtual: never}`. Yes it used to be that case before TypeScript 3.9. But afterward they introduced this feature to reduce empty intersections to `never` immediately upon construction. Check out [this PR](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36696) for details and motivation.

## Don’t extend type algebra

There are some type annotations in TypeScript that you might think they are equivalent but actually they are not:

- `(number | string) []` and`number[] | string[]` - the former represents an array of numbers and/or strings and the latter means an array of numbers or an array of strings.
- `keyof (A & B`) and `keyof A & keyof B` - the former gives you a union of literal strings of the property names of the intersection of type `A` and `B` and the latter gives you an intersection of two union of literal strings of the property names of type `A and B`.
- `typeof foo & typeof bar` and `typeof (foo & bar)`  - the latter is not even valid TypeScript.
